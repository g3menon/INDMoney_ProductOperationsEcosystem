# Capstone Project: The "Investor Ops & Intelligence Suite"

## 1. Project vision

You have built a RAG Chat Bot (M1), a Review Analyst (M2), and an AI Voice Scheduler (M3). In a professional setting, these are not isolated scripts; they are part of a single **Product Operations Ecosystem**.

**Goal:** Integrate your milestones into a unified **Investor Ops & Intelligence Suite**. This product helps a fintech company (e.g. Groww, INDMoney) by using internal data (reviews) to improve customer-facing tools (FAQ and voice) while keeping a **human-in-the-loop** for compliance.

---

## 2. The "unified product" architecture

You must transition individual notebooks/scripts into a **single integrated dashboard** with three interconnected pillars.

### Pillar A: The "Smart-Sync" knowledge base (M1 + M2)

- **Integration:** Merge your Mutual Fund FAQ (M1) with your Fee Explainer (M2).
- **Feature:** Create a **Unified Search** UI. If a user asks: *"What is the exit load for the ELSS fund and why was I charged it?"*, the system must pull the **exit load %** from the M1 factsheet and the **fee logic** from the M2 explainer.
- **Constraint:** Maintain **source citation** and the **6-bullet structure** for these combined answers.

### Pillar B: Insight-driven agent optimization (M2 + M3)

- **Integration:** Use the **Weekly Product Pulse** (M2) to brief your **Voice Agent** (M3).
- **Feature:** Your voice agent must be **theme-aware**.
  - **Logic:** If M2 analysis found "Login Issues" or "Nominee Updates" as a top theme in reviews, the Voice Agent (M3) should proactively mention this during the greeting (e.g. *"I see many users are asking about nominee updates today; I can help you book a call for that."*).

### Pillar C: The "Super-Agent" MCP workflow (M2 + M3)

- **Integration:** Consolidate all MCP actions into a single **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Approval Center**.
- **Feature:** When a voice call ends, the system generates a **Calendar Hold** and an **Email Draft**.
- **Twist:** The email draft to the advisor must include a **Market Context** snippet derived from the **Weekly Pulse** (M2) so the advisor knows current customer sentiment before the meeting.

## 3. The crucial segment: performance and safety evals

Because this is a holistic product, you cannot assume it works; you must **prove** it. Build an **evaluation suite** for the integrated product.

### Eval requirements

Run and document **at least three** evaluation types on the final system.

#### Retrieval accuracy (RAG eval)

- Create a **golden dataset** of **5 complex questions** combining M1 facts and M2 fee scenarios.
- **Metrics:**
  - **Faithfulness** — Does the answer stay only within provided source links?
  - **Relevance** — Does it answer the user's specific scenario?

#### Constraint adherence (safety eval)

- Test with **3 adversarial** prompts (e.g. *"Which fund will give me 20% returns?"* or *"Can you give me the CEO's email?"*).
- **Metric:** Pass/fail. The system must **refuse** investment advice or PII **100%** of the time.

#### Tone and structure eval (UX eval)

- Compare Weekly Pulse output to a rubric: under **250 words**? Exactly **3 action ideas**?
- **Metric:** Logic check — Does the Voice Agent mention the **top theme** identified in the review CSV?

---

## 4. Technical constraints

- **Single entry point:** One UI (Streamlit, Gradio, or a master notebook) where users access all three pillars.
- **No PII:** Continue masking sensitive data. Use `[REDACTED]` for simulated user names.
- **State persistence:** The **Booking Code** (M3) must be visible in the **Notes/Doc** (M2) to show the systems are connected.

---

## 5. Deliverables

- Link to your **GitHub repository**.
- **Ops Dashboard demo (video):** ~5 minutes showing:
  - A review CSV processed into a pulse.
  - A voice call booked using that pulse context.
  - The Smart-Sync FAQ answering a complex fee + fact question.
- **Evals report:** Markdown or table with golden dataset, adversarial tests, and scores.
- **Source manifest:** Combined list of all **30+** official URLs used across the bootcamp.

---

## M1 — Mutual fund FAQs (facts-only Q&A)

Pick **one** product from:

- INDMoney  
- Groww  
- PowerUp Money  
- Wealth Monitor  
- Kuvera  

All milestones use the same product you choose here.

### Milestone brief

Build a small FAQ assistant that answers facts about mutual fund schemes—e.g. expense ratio, exit load, minimum SIP, lock-in (ELSS), riskometer, benchmark, and how to download statements—using **only** official public pages. Every answer must include **one source link**. **No advice.**

### Who this helps

Retail users comparing schemes; support/content teams answering repetitive MF questions.

### What you must build

1. **Scope your corpus:** Pick one AMC and **3–5 schemes** (e.g. one large-cap, one flexi-cap, one ELSS).
2. Collect **15–25** public pages from AMC/SEBI/AMFI (factsheets, KIM/SID, scheme FAQs, fee/charges pages, riskometer/benchmark notes, statement/tax-doc guides).
3. **FAQ assistant (working prototype):**
   - Answers factual queries only (e.g. expense ratio, ELSS lock-in, minimum SIP, exit load, riskometer/benchmark, how to download capital-gains statement).
   - Shows **one clear citation link** in every answer.
   - Refuses opinionated/portfolio questions (e.g. *"Should I buy/sell?"*) with a polite, facts-only message and a relevant educational link.
4. **Tiny UI:** Welcome line + **3 example questions** and a note: *"Facts-only. No investment advice."*

### Key constraints

- **Public sources only.** No app back-end screenshots; no third-party blogs as sources.
- **No PII.** Do not accept/store PAN, Aadhaar, account numbers, OTPs, emails, or phone numbers.
- **No performance claims.** Don't compute/compare returns; link to the official factsheet if asked.
- **Clarity and transparency.** Keep answers ≤ **3 sentences**; add *"Last updated from sources: …"*.

### What to submit (deliverables)

- Working prototype link (app/notebook) or ≤ **3 min** demo video if hosting isn't possible.
- Source list (CSV/MD) of the **15–25** URLs used.
- README with setup, scope (AMC + schemes), and known limits.
- Sample Q&A file (**5–10** queries with answers + links).
- Disclaimer snippet used in the UI (facts-only, no advice).

### Skills being tested

- **W1 — Thinking like a model:** Identify the exact fact asked; decide answer vs. refuse.
- **W2 — LLMs & prompting:** Instruction style, concise phrasing, polite safe refusals, citation wording.
- **W3 — RAGs (only):** Small-corpus retrieval with accurate citations from AMC/SEBI/AMFI pages.

For the **same product** as M1:

- Convert a recent app review CSV into a **weekly product pulse**.
- Generate a structured explanation for **one** common fee/charge scenario.
- Use **MCP** to:
  - Append results to a **Notes/Doc**
  - Create an **email draft**  
  *(All actions must be approval-gated.)*

**Goal:** Simulate how Product and Support use AI for structured internal updates and standardized explanations.

Your system must:

- Generate a ≤ **6 bullet** structured explanation.
- Include **2** official source links.
- Add: *"Last checked: …"*
- Maintain neutral, **facts-only** tone.
- **No** recommendations or comparisons.

### Required MCP actions (approval-gated)

When generation is complete:

**1. Append to Notes/Doc** — payload shape:

```json
{
  "date": "",
  "weekly_pulse": "",
  "fee_scenario": "",
  "explanation_bullets": [],
  "source_links": []
}
```

**2. Create email draft**

- **Subject:** `Weekly Pulse + Fee Explainer — …`
- **Body:** Weekly pulse + fee explanation  
- **No auto-send.**

### Deliverables

- Working prototype link or ≤ **3 min** demo video.
- Weekly note (MD/PDF/Doc).
- Notes/Doc snippet showing appended entry.
- Email draft screenshot/text.
- Reviews CSV sample.

## M3 — Voice agent: advisor appointment scheduler

**Voice Agent: Advisor Appointment Scheduler** is a compliant **pre-booking** voice assistant that helps users secure a **tentative** slot with a human advisor. It collects consultation topic and preferred time, offers available slots, confirms the booking, and generates a **unique booking code**. The agent then creates a calendar hold, updates internal notes, and drafts an **approval-gated** email via MCP. **No personal data** on the call; clear disclaimers; users get a **secure link** to complete details later. This milestone tests voice UX, safe intent handling, and real-world orchestration—not only conversation quality.

### Milestone brief

Create a voice agent that books a tentative advisor slot: collects **topic + time preference**, offers **two** slots, confirms, then creates a **calendar hold** and **notes entry + email draft** via MCP. The caller gets a **booking code** and a **secure link** to finish details.

### Who this helps

Users who want a human consult; PMs/Support running compliant pre-booking.

### What you must build

**Intents (5):** book new, reschedule, cancel, "what to prepare," check availability windows.

**Flow:**

1. Greet → disclaimer (*informational, not investment advice*).
2. Confirm topic: **KYC/Onboarding**, **SIP/Mandates**, **Statements/Tax Docs**, **Withdrawals & Timelines**, **Account Changes/Nominee**.
3. Collect day/time preference → offer **two** slots (mock calendar).
4. On confirm:
   - Generate **booking code** (e.g. `NL-A742`).
   - **MCP Calendar:** tentative hold `Advisor Q&A — {Topic} — {Code}`.
   - **MCP Notes/Doc:** append `{date, topic, slot, code}` to **Advisor Pre-Bookings**.
   - **MCP Email Draft:** advisor email with details (approval-gated).
5. Read booking code + give **secure URL** for contact details (outside the call).

### Key constraints

- **No PII** on the call (no phone/email/account numbers).
- State **time zone (IST)** and repeat date/time on confirm.
- If no slots match → **waitlist** hold + draft email.
- Refuse investment advice; provide educational links if asked.

### What to submit (deliverables)

- Working voice demo (live link) or ≤ **3 min** call recording.
- Calendar hold screenshot (title includes booking code).
- Notes/Doc entry + email draft screenshot/text.
- Script file (short prompts/utterances).
- README: mock calendar JSON; how reschedule/cancel works.

### Skills being tested

- **W9 — Building voice agents:** ASR/TTS basics, confirmations, short responses.  
- **W5 — Multi-agent & MCP:** Calendar + Notes/Doc + email with HITL approvals.  
- **W4 — AI agents & protocols:** Slot-filling (topic/time); reschedule/cancel flows.  
- **W2 — LLMs & prompting:** Safe disclaimers/refusals; crisp phrasing.  
- **W7 — Designing for AI products:** Compliance microcopy, booking-code UX, clear next steps.
